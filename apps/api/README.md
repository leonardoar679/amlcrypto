# Blockchain AML API

FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2 + Alembic. SQLite by default, MySQL 8 as the alternative.

## Setup (Windows PowerShell; Python 3.11+, tested on 3.13)

```powershell
cd apps\api
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -c constraints.txt -e ".[dev,mysql]"
copy .env.example .env      # then edit; SECRET_KEY is optional only while ENVIRONMENT=dev
```

## Everyday commands

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.cli migrate                          # create/upgrade the database
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.cli create-user --email you@example.com --org-name "Your Org"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:create_app --factory --reload   # http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check . ; .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff format --check .
```

`alembic` works from this directory too (`alembic upgrade head`, `alembic check`); it reads
`DATABASE_URL` through the same settings. New migrations take explicit ids:
`alembic revision --rev-id 0004 -m "describe the change"`.

## Data providers and the worker

Chain data comes from hosted providers (Etherscan V2, Alchemy, TronGrid, Helius, and a public Esplora
endpoint for Bitcoin while developing). Every provider is optional: one without a key is skipped, and
the platform says so instead of guessing. Put keys in `.env` (see `.env.example`).

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.cli providers                  # what is configured, limits, chains (no network)
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.cli probe esplora              # one live request: is it reachable, does the key work
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.cli enqueue PROVIDER_PROBE --set provider=esplora
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.worker --once                  # run everything that is due, then exit
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.worker                         # run until Ctrl+C (a second Ctrl+C stops at once)
```

What the provider layer guarantees (`app/providers/`, one `ProviderClient` for all calls):

* **Keys never leak.** They are attached in one place, registered for scrubbing, and absent from
  errors, API responses and log lines (the JSON formatter scrubs every line, and the HTTP client's own
  request logging is switched off). Error messages carry a status and a reason, never a URL.
* **Limits are respected.** A token bucket per provider (defaults are cautious; override with
  `PROVIDER_RATE_LIMITS`), a cap on concurrent requests, retries with exponential backoff and jitter on
  timeouts, 429 and 5xx, `Retry-After` honoured (a long one blocks the provider and is handed to the job
  queue instead of being slept through), and a circuit breaker that stops calling a provider that keeps
  failing. Rejected keys (401/403) and malformed requests (other 4xx) are not retried.
* **Quota is visible.** Every network attempt, retries included, is counted per provider per hour in
  `api_usage`; an optional per-investigation `RequestBudget` caps what one job may spend; repeatable
  GETs can be cached in memory (`cache_ttl`).
* **Fallback.** `first_success()` tries providers in order and reports every reason if none works.

The worker (`app/worker/`) claims jobs from `fetch_jobs` with a compare-and-set that is safe on both
SQLite and MySQL, runs async handlers with no database transaction open, retries failures with
backoff (or at the time a provider asked for), gives up at once on failures that waiting cannot fix
(bad key, missing key, malformed request), cancels a handler after `JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, hands jobs
back on shutdown, and requeues the jobs of a worker that died. Handlers are registered in
`app/worker/handlers.py`; milestone M4 adds the first real ones.

Things to know:

* Run **one worker process per SQLite database**. Rate limits and circuit breakers live in the process,
  so two workers would each use the full allowance.
* The circuit and last-error fields of `GET /providers` describe the API process only; `usage_24h`
  comes from the database and includes the worker's calls.
* Any authenticated user can read provider status and trigger a probe (one request of quota) until
  roles arrive in M13.

## Testing against MySQL

Point `TEST_DATABASE_URL` at an **empty, throwaway** MySQL 8 database and run the suite as usual:

```powershell
$env:TEST_DATABASE_URL = "mysql+pymysql://root:root@127.0.0.1:3306/aml_test"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
```

The schema is migrated once per session and every test is rolled back afterwards. CI does this
with a `mysql:8.0` service (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## HTTP API (`/api/v1`)

| Method and path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health` | none | liveness plus a database round trip (503 when the database is down) |
| `GET /version` | none | app version and schema revision (`schema_up_to_date`) |
| `POST /auth/login` | none | email and password for a bearer token |
| `GET /chains` | bearer | supported chains, in registry order, with `enabled` |
| `POST /address/validate` | bearer | validate an address on one chain (`chain`: slug or CAIP-2 id) or detect every chain it is valid on |
| `GET /providers` | bearer | each data provider: configured or not, limits, chains (paid ones apart), circuit state, last error, 24-hour usage. Never a key |
| `POST /providers/{name}/probe` | bearer | one live health request to that provider; the answer says what is wrong in words (`ok`, `auth_failed`, `rate_limited`, `unreachable`, `unhealthy`, `not_configured` ...) |

Every error uses one envelope: `{"success": false, "error": {"code", "message", "request_id"}}`.
Interactive docs are at `/api/docs` unless `ENVIRONMENT=prod`.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/main.py` | `create_app()` factory (run with `--factory`) |
| `app/core/` | settings, JSON logging, password hashing and JWTs |
| `app/database/` | engine/session setup, models, programmatic Alembic access |
| `app/api/v1/` | HTTP routes under `/api/v1` |
| `app/chains/` | per-chain address validation and the chain registry |
| `app/providers/` | provider catalogue, HTTP client, throttle, circuit breaker, cache, budget, fallback, usage |
| `app/worker/` | the job runner (`python -m app.worker`) and its handlers |
| `app/database/repositories/` | job queue and usage counters |
| `migrations/` | Alembic environment and versions |
| `tests/` | pytest suite |

## Conventions that are easy to break

* Integer keys use `IntegerPK` (BIGINT, INTEGER on SQLite), identifier columns use
  `identifier(n)` (case-sensitive on MySQL), timestamps use `UTCDateTime`. See
  `app/database/models/base.py` for why.
* Amounts are integer strings, never floats.
* Migrations are written by hand and kept self-contained; `alembic check` must stay clean. A
  downgrade must not drop an index of a table it drops anyway (MySQL error 1553); a test guards this.
* Never put a provider API key in a log line or an error message.
* SQLite has two session modes. `create_session_factory(engine)` is read-only (writes fail at once);
  anything that writes uses `create_session_factory(engine, write=True)` and keeps its transaction
  short. Never hold a write transaction across network I/O. See `app/database/connection.py`.

## Known gaps (tracked in the project plan)

* No login rate limiting or lockout yet.
* **MySQL:** the whole suite passed on MySQL 8.0 and 8.4 in CI for milestones M1 and M2 (commit
  `1773682`). The M3 tables and concurrency tests have not run against MySQL yet; they do on the next push.
* **Docker:** CI builds `Dockerfile`, runs the container and calls `/health` and `/version`, and checks
  that `deployment/docker-compose.yml` parses. Nothing has been run with Docker on the development
  machine, and the compose file's worker service has only been syntax-checked.
* The Bitcoin source for production is undecided. Esplora is public with no published limits;
  Alchemy's Bitcoin address API is sold as a separate add-on and its docs do not say whether the free
  plan includes it. Decide in milestone M6.
* BNB Smart Chain is not on Etherscan's free plan. Decide the source in milestone M4.
